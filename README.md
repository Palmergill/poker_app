   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Apply migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
6. Create a superuser:
   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser

## Using the VS Code Quick Start

For convenience, a startup script and VS Code configuration have been provided:

1. Make sure the `start_poker_app.py` file is in your project root
2. Create a `.vscode` directory at your project root
3. Place `tasks.json` and `launch.json` in the `.vscode` directory
4. In VS Code, use the shortcuts:
   - `Ctrl+Shift+B` to start the entire application
   - `F5` to debug the Django backend

Alternatively, use the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and select "Tasks: Run Task" to see available tasks.
